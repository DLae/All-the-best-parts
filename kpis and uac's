Key Performance Indicators:
Some of the main key performance indicators for the digital solution for Health Advice Group would consist of the solution being up to date, both with the weather forecasts and the best ways to go about the health/weather concerns that the solution gives the users.
The main KPI's consist of:
	The accuracy of the weather forecasts for the day and the on coming week

	How satisfied each user is with the content that is being provided
	The response time for between the users request and the output
	The reviews that the users are leaving, with the reviews that users are leaving, it gives a good indication as to what may need to be improved, and what is already good as it is, so when new updates are in development, the users feeback will be noted and the solution can be based more around what the users think

	The amount of different health-based resources that are being used
